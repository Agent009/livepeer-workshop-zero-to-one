# From Zero to One

Welcome to the workshop!

Here is everything you need to know to get started hacking. We'll go over all of this in the workshop presentation, but if you prefer to get started on your own, please feel free to do so.

We will be available in Discord to help answer questions and give guidance on your projects.

## About Livepeer AI Pipelines

Currently, Livepeer AI offers six different pipelines to work with. Several of these pipelines allow you to select which model you wish to use. Please note that there is a concept of 'warm' and 'cold' models. Warm models are already loaded and ready to go. Cold models will take extra time to load before serving your request. For this reason, we suggest primarily using warm models.
